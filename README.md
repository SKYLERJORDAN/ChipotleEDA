# Chipotle Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Chipotle order data to uncover insights about customer behavior, popular items, and pricing patterns. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we explore and visualize data to make data-driven conclusions about the dataset.

## Key Findings

- **Popular Items**: An analysis of the most frequently ordered items and their popularity.
- **Revenue Trends**: Insights on total revenue, order averages, and other financial metrics.
- **Customer Preferences**: Examination of ingredient preferences and customization patterns.

## Repository Contents

- **`chipotle-analysis-updated.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
- **`data/`**: Contains the Chipotle dataset (not included for privacy reasons; see below for data acquisition).
- **`README.md`**: Project overview, findings, and instructions (this file).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
